This is a collection of code snippets that are syntactically valid
only since Python *X*.\ *Y*, for most *X*.\ *Y* â‰¥ 2.4.

For example:

.. code:: python

   0_0  # Python >= 3.6 is required

The idea is to put such a snippet near the top of your file.
If a user inadvertently ran the code it against an older version,
they would get a somewhat useful error message:

.. code:: console

   $ python3.5 since-3.6.py
     File "since-3.6.py", line 1
       0_0  # Python >= 3.6 is required
         ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

.. vim:ft=rst ts=3 sts=3 sw=3 et
